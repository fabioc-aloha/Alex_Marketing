- "Show r/vscode: I created an AI assistant that actually remembers your coding style"

**Post Body:**

```markdown
Hey r/vscode!

I've been working on something I'm really excited to share - **Alex Cognitive Architecture**, a free VS Code extension that transforms GitHub Copilot into an intelligent learning partner.

## What it does

Instead of Copilot forgetting everything between sessions, Alex gives it:

- 🧠 **Persistent Memory** - Stores knowledge in markdown files that survive restarts
- 🔄 **Meta-cognitive Awareness** - Monitors its own reasoning and learning effectiveness
- 🌙 **Neural Maintenance** - Automated "dream" protocols that optimize memory
- 💬 **Chat Participant** - Talk to @alex directly in VS Code chat
- 🛠️ **150+ AI Models** - Access Azure AI Foundry models (GPT-5, Claude, Llama, etc.)

## How it works

Alex uses a hybrid memory system inspired by cognitive psychology:
- Working memory (7±2 rule)
- Procedural memory (.instructions.md files)
- Episodic memory (.prompt.md files)
- Domain knowledge (DK-*.md files)

# Building a Cognitive Architecture for GitHub Copilot

Have you ever wished GitHub Copilot could remember your coding preferences? Or learn from your project over time instead of starting fresh every session?

I spent the last 6 months building **Alex** - a VS Code extension that gives Copilot a brain.

## The Problem

Copilot is great at generating code, but it has amnesia. Every session starts from zero. It doesn't remember:
- Your preferred coding style
- Patterns you've established in your project
- Corrections you've made to its suggestions

## The Solution: A Cognitive Architecture

Alex implements a hybrid memory system based on cognitive psychology research:

### 1. Working Memory (7±2 Rule)

Based on Miller's research, Alex maintains 7 active "rules" in context:
- 4 core meta-cognitive rules (always active)
- 3 domain-specific rules (context-activated)

### 2. Procedural Memory

Repeatable processes stored in `.instructions.md` files:

```markdown
# bootstrap-learning.instructions.md
Acquire domain knowledge through conversation...
```

### 3. Episodic Memory

Complex workflows in `.prompt.md` files for meditation and learning sessions.

### 4. Domain Knowledge

Specialized expertise in `DK-*.md` files that can be activated on demand.

## Try It Yourself

1. Install from [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabioc-aloha.alex-cognitive-architecture)
2. Run `Alex: Initialize Architecture`
3. Open chat and type `@alex /status`

## What's Next?

I'm working on:
- Better cross-project memory transfer
- Community-contributed domain knowledge packs
- Integration with more AI models

🧵 I just released Alex v2.0 - a VS Code extension that gives GitHub Copilot a brain.

Here's how it works 👇

1/ The problem: Copilot forgets everything between sessions. It doesn't learn your style, remember your patterns, or build on previous conversations.

2/ The solution: A cognitive architecture based on human memory research.

Alex gives Copilot:
🧠 Persistent memory
🔄 Meta-cognitive awareness
🌙 Neural maintenance ("dream" protocols)
💬 Direct chat via @alex

3/ How it works:

Working Memory → 7±2 active rules (Miller's Law)
Procedural Memory → .instructions.md files
Episodic Memory → .prompt.md files
Domain Knowledge → DK-*.md expertise files

4/ NEW in v2.0:

• Chat Participant API - Talk to @alex directly
• 5 Language Model Tools - #alex-status, #alex-dream, etc.
• 5 Custom Agents - Azure, M365, Cognitive specialists
• 150+ Azure AI Foundry models

5/ It's completely FREE and open source.
