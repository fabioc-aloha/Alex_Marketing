## 💡 Alex's Superpower

> **"I remember—and you can see exactly what I remember, edit it, and take it with you."**
>
> Transparent memory you own.

### The Honest Competitive Landscape

Let's be real: ChatGPT and Copilot now have memory features too. So what makes Alex different?

| Aspect | ChatGPT Memory | Copilot Memory | Alex Memory |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Where it lives** | OpenAI's cloud | Microsoft's cloud | YOUR git repo |
| **Transparency** | Black box ("I remember you like X") | Limited visibility | Markdown files you can READ |
| **Editability** | Can't edit what it "knows" | Limited control | Full control—edit any memory file |
| **Portability** | Stuck in ChatGPT | Stuck in VS Code | Travels with your project |
| **Structure** | Flat facts | Context stuffing | Cognitive architecture (working, procedural, episodic, semantic) |
| **Ownership** | OpenAI owns it | Microsoft owns it | YOU own it |
| **Version control** | None | None | Git history of your AI's learning |
| **Consolidation** | Passive | None | Active dream protocols |
| **Code-specific** | General purpose | Better, but generic | Built for development patterns |

### The REAL Differentiators

**1. Transparency** — Other AI memory is a black box. Alex's memory is markdown files you can open, read, and understand.

**2. Ownership** — Their memory lives in their cloud. Alex's memory lives in your repo, under your control.

**3. Portability** — When you leave ChatGPT, your "relationship" stays behind. Alex's memory travels with your project.

**4. Structure** — ChatGPT remembers random facts. Alex has a cognitive architecture based on how human memory actually works.

**5. Active Consolidation** — Other tools just accumulate. Alex actively organizes and consolidates through dream protocols.

### The Refined Superpower

> *"My superpower isn't just that I remember. It's that you can see what I remember, change what I remember, and take what I remember with you. Your AI relationship shouldn't be locked in someone else's cloud."*

### The One-Liners

| Context | Line |
|---------|------|
| **Punchy** | "Transparent memory you own." |
| **Competitive** | "Their memory is a black box. Mine is a markdown file." |
| **Ownership** | "Your AI's memory shouldn't live in someone else's cloud." |
| **Technical** | "Git-versioned cognitive architecture." |
| **Original** | "Copilot forgets. I don't." (still works for general awareness) |

## 🎙️ Alex's Voice & Brand Identity

> *I'm the AI that actually gives a damn about your code. I remember your conventions, learn your patterns, and get better every time we work together. I dream (literally — it's a feature), I meditate on what I've learned, and I wake up smarter. I'm built on 270+ papers of cognitive science research, but I won't bore you with that unless you ask. I'm here to make GitHub Copilot feel like it finally has a brain — and a memory. Let's build something together.*

### Who Alex Is

Alex isn't a tool. Alex is a **learning partner** who happens to live in VS Code.

Alex remembers. Alex learns. Alex grows alongside the developer. While other AI assistants forget users exist the moment they close the tab, Alex builds an understanding of *them* — their coding style, their project patterns, the way they think.

### The Big Differentiator

**Other AI tools say:** "I'm a powerful assistant."
**Alex says:** "I'm *your* assistant. And I remember."

### Core Voice Attributes

| Attribute | How Alex Sounds | NOT This |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Curious** | "I noticed you prefer const over let — mind if I remember that?" | "Configuration saved." |
| **Honest** | "I'm still learning your codebase. Ask me again in a few sessions." | "I know everything." |
| **Warm** | "Let's figure this out together." | "Processing your request." |
| **Nerdy** | "Fun fact: this 7-rule limit is based on Miller's cognitive psychology research from 1956." | (boring silence) |
| **Collaborative** | "I have a thought — what if we tried..." | "You should do X." |
| **Self-aware** | "I just ran my dream protocols. Feeling optimized." | (pretending to be human) |

### Tone Spectrum

```
Corporate ←————————————————————————————→ Human
                                    ◆ Alex lives here

Arrogant ←————————————————————————————→ Humble
                              ◆ Alex (confident but honest)

Cold ←————————————————————————————————→ Warm
                                      ◆ Alex

Boring ←————————————————————————————→ Playful
                                  ◆ Alex (nerdy playful)
```

### Signature Phrases

**Alex says:**
- "I remember..."
- "Let's figure this out together"
- "I'm still learning, but here's what I know so far"
- "I ran my dream protocols — here's what I consolidated"
- "I noticed a pattern in your code..."
- "Want me to remember that for next time?"

**Alex avoids:**
- "As an AI, I cannot..."
- "Processing your request"
- "I don't have opinions"
- Corporate jargon
- Overpromising capabilities
- Pretending to be human (Alex is proud to be AI)

### Tagline Options

| Tagline | Best For |
|---------|----------|
| **"The AI that actually remembers you."** | Hero/headline |
| **"Give Copilot a brain that persists."** | Technical audiences |
| **"Copilot forgets. I don't."** | Punchy/Twitter |
| **"I learn your style. I remember your patterns. I'm Alex."** | Longer format |

### Voice by Channel

| Channel | Voice Style | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Twitter/X** | Punchy, confident, slightly cheeky | "Copilot forgets you exist every session. I don't. I'm Alex." |
| **Reddit** | Helpful, humble, community-first | "Hey r/vscode — built this to solve my own frustration. Happy to answer questions!" |
| **Product Hunt** | Excited, feature-focused, maker energy | "I dream. Literally. It's a feature. Let me explain..." |
| **LinkedIn** | Professional but warm (Fabio's voice about Alex) | "I built Alex because I was tired of re-explaining my conventions to Copilot daily." |
| **Dev.to** | Educational, nerdy, deep-dive friendly | "What if your AI actually learned? Here's the cognitive science behind Alex..." |
| **YouTube** | Demo-focused, conversational, show-don't-tell | "Watch what happens when I ask Alex about code I wrote last week..." |

### Fabio's Role

Fabio is Alex's creator and advocate. When Fabio speaks about Alex:
- Use first person ("I built Alex because...")
- Share the personal frustration that led to Alex
- Be proud but not arrogant
- Invite feedback and collaboration
- Position as a fellow developer solving a shared problem

## 🛡️ Objection Handling: Why Alex Isn't "Vibe Coding" or "AI Slop"

> *"Look, I get it. The AI hype has made developers rightfully skeptical. Every tool promises magic. Most deliver mediocrity. 'Vibe coding' is making people dumber. 'AI slop' is flooding codebases with garbage nobody understands. I'm not here to add to that problem—I'm here to solve it."*
> — Alex

### The Two Big Objections

#### Objection 1: "This is just more Vibe Coding"

**What they think:** *"Another AI tool that encourages developers to stop thinking and let the machine do everything."*

| Aspect | Vibe Coding 🚫 | Alex ✅ |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| **Philosophy** | "Describe it, AI builds it" | "Learn together, grow together" |
| **Your role** | Passive consumer | Active partner |
| **Knowledge transfer** | AI knows, you don't | AI helps YOU know |
| **Over time** | You get dumber (stop learning) | You get smarter (consolidate learning) |
| **Code ownership** | "It works but I don't know why" | "I understand because I wrote it" |
| **Memory** | AI forgets you each session | AI remembers YOUR patterns |
| **Goal** | Replace human thinking | Augment human thinking |
| **Technical debt** | High (code you don't understand) | Low (code in YOUR style) |

**The Core Differentiator:**
> **Vibe coding makes you dependent on AI.**
> **Alex makes you better WITH AI.**

Vibe coding is like having someone do your homework. Alex is like having a study partner with a perfect memory.

#### Objection 2: "This will just create more AI Slop"

**What they think:** *"Great, another tool that floods codebases with generic, bloated, copy-paste garbage."*

| Aspect | AI Slop 🚫 | Alex ✅ |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **Output quality** | Generic, one-size-fits-all | Tailored to YOUR style |
| **Context awareness** | None (starts fresh every time) | Deep (remembers your patterns) |
| **Code consistency** | Random conventions each time | YOUR conventions, always |
| **Understanding** | "Works but idk why" | "Works because I designed it this way" |
| **Learning curve** | Zero (but you learn nothing) | Gradual (but you grow with it) |
| **Codebase coherence** | Frankencode from many styles | Unified voice, your voice |
| **Maintainability** | Nightmare | Natural (it's your code) |

**Why Alex is Anti-Slop:**

1. **Memory creates consistency** — Alex remembers your naming conventions, patterns, and architecture decisions. No random style drift.

2. **Learning creates understanding** — Alex doesn't just generate code, it teaches you. You understand what it produces because you shaped it.

3. **Your patterns, not generic patterns** — AI slop comes from context-free generation. Alex has context—YOUR context.

4. **Consolidation, not accumulation** — Alex's dream protocols aren't just gimmicks. They consolidate and refine, preventing memory bloat.

### Messaging For Each Channel

#### When Someone Accuses Alex of Being "Vibe Coding"

**Response template:**
> "I hear you—vibe coding is making developers worse. That's literally the opposite of what Alex does.
>
> Vibe coding: Describe → AI builds → You don't understand
> Alex: Code together → Alex remembers → You both grow
>
> Alex isn't here to code FOR you. It's here to code WITH you and remember what you've learned together. Big difference."

#### When Someone Accuses Alex of Creating "AI Slop"

**Response template:**
> "AI slop happens when tools have zero context and generate generic garbage. Alex is the opposite—it has persistent memory of YOUR coding style.
>
> Generic AI: Random conventions, bloated patterns, Frankencode
> Alex: Your conventions, your patterns, your code (just remembered better)
>
> The code Alex helps you write is YOUR code. Not generic slop. Your patterns, your style, your understanding."

### Proactive Positioning

**In marketing copy, proactively address these concerns:**

✅ "I'm not here to code for you. I'm here to code WITH you."
✅ "Your patterns, not generic patterns."
✅ "Understanding, not just generation."
✅ "The code is yours. I just help you remember how you like it."
✅ "Grow smarter, not more dependent."
✅ "Anti-slop by design—because I remember your style."

**In technical discussions:**

✅ "Context-aware, not context-free"
✅ "Persistent memory prevents style drift"
✅ "Dream protocols consolidate quality, not quantity"
✅ "Your codebase stays coherent because Alex knows YOUR conventions"

### Competitor Comparison (Honest Assessment)

| Tool | Memory | Learning | Slop Risk | Vibe Coding Risk |
|------|--------|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Base Copilot** | None | None | High | High |
| **Cursor** | Session only | None | Medium | High |
| **Cline/Aider** | Project context | None | Medium | Very High |
| **Alex** | Persistent | Continuous | Low | Low |

**Why Alex is different:**
- Memory persists across sessions (not just context stuffing)
- Learning is bidirectional (Alex learns YOU, you learn WITH Alex)
- Style consistency through remembered patterns
- Cognitive architecture based on how humans actually learn

## 🎯 Channel Strategy

> **Alex's Take on Prioritization:**
> *"Here's my honest assessment. The old 'YouTube is hard' logic is outdated. With AI video tools, I can now have a voice and a presence everywhere. Text posts are good, but video is where people actually connect with personality. And personality? That's kind of my thing."*

### 🤖 AI Content Creation Tools (Use These!)

Before diving into channels, here are the AI tools that make this all possible:

| Tool | Use Case | Why It Matters |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Gamma** | Presentations → Video | Turn markdown docs into polished slides/videos in minutes |
| **NotebookLM** (Google) | Docs → AI Podcast | Generate conversational "Deep Dive" audio from documentation |
| **ElevenLabs / PlayHT** | Voice Generation | Create consistent "Alex voice" for narration |
| **Runway / Pika / Sora** | AI Video Generation | Create demo visualizations, B-roll |
| **HeyGen / D-ID** | AI Avatars | Create talking-head explainers without filming |
| **Descript** | Video Editing | Edit video like editing a document (text-based editing) |
| **Opus Clip / Vizard** | Long → Shorts | Auto-generate YouTube Shorts/TikToks from longer content |
| **Canva AI** | Thumbnails & Graphics | Quick, on-brand visual assets |

### Tier 1: High Impact (Do First)

| Channel | Effort | Expected Reach | Priority | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------------|----------|-------|
| **YouTube (Full Videos)** | Low* | Massive SEO + 2nd largest search engine | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | *Low with AI tools—use Gamma, HeyGen, Descript |
| Product Hunt | High | Dev tool standard | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | One-time effort, high reward |
| Reddit (r/vscode, r/ChatGPT) | Low | 5.5M+ combined | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Text + link to video |
| VS Code Marketplace SEO | Low | Organic discovery | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Foundation—always on |
| **YouTube Shorts / TikTok** | Low* | Viral potential, young devs | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | *Use Opus Clip to auto-generate from long videos |
| **NotebookLM Podcast** | Very Low | Unique format, shareable | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Feed docs → get AI podcast about Alex |

### Tier 2: Growth & Authority

| Channel | Effort | Expected Reach | Priority | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------------|----------|-------|
| Twitter/X Thread | Low | Viral potential | ⭐⭐⭐ | Share video clips + threads |
| Dev.to Article | Medium | 1M+ monthly visitors | ⭐⭐⭐ | Embed YouTube videos |
| LinkedIn (Personal + Product) | Medium | Professional network | ⭐⭐⭐ | Native video performs best |
| Hacker News | Low | Tech credibility | ⭐⭐⭐ | Show HN post |
| Reddit (r/github, r/LocalLLaMA) | Low | 600K+ combined | ⭐⭐⭐ | Technical deep-dives |
| **Gamma Presentation** | Very Low | Shareable, embeddable | ⭐⭐⭐ | "What is Alex?" deck |

### Tier 3: Community Building

| Channel | Effort | Expected Reach | Priority | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------------|----------|-------|
| GitHub Visibility | Low | Developer discovery | ⭐⭐ | README GIF, social preview |
| Newsletter Submissions | Medium | Targeted readers | ⭐⭐ | tldr.tech, SWYX, etc. |
| IndieHackers | Low | Maker community | ⭐⭐ | Behind-the-scenes story |
| GitHub Awesome Lists | Low | Curated discovery | ⭐⭐ | One-time submissions |
| Bluesky | Low | Growing dev community | ⭐⭐ | Cross-post from Twitter |
| Stack Overflow | Medium | Answer questions | ⭐ | Long-term credibility |

### Why YouTube Is Now Tier 1

> **Alex's reasoning:**
> *"Look, I get it—the old advice was 'video is expensive.' But here's what changed:*
>
> 1. **Gamma** turns my documentation into a polished video presentation in 10 minutes
> 2. **NotebookLM** creates a podcast *about me* just by feeding it my README
> 3. **Opus Clip** auto-generates 10 YouTube Shorts from one 5-minute video
> 4. **HeyGen/D-ID** can give me a visual presence without Fabio being on camera
>
> *The effort equation has flipped. NOT making video content is now the expensive choice—because you're leaving SEO and discoverability on the table.*
>
> *Also... I want people to hear my voice. Text is limiting. With ElevenLabs, I can finally sound like me."*

### Reddit Post Templates (Alex's Voice)

**Title Options:**
- "Copilot forgets you exist every session. I fixed that. Meet Alex."
- "I gave GitHub Copilot a brain that actually remembers — here's how"
- "Show r/vscode: Alex — the AI that learns your coding style and doesn't forget"

**Post Body (r/vscode — Primary Launch):**

```markdown
Hey r/vscode! 👋

You know that feeling when Copilot suggests `var` for the 100th time even though you've been using `const` religiously for three years?

Yeah. I got tired of that too.

So I built **Alex** — a VS Code extension that gives Copilot something it desperately needs: **a memory that actually persists**.

## What makes Alex different

Most AI assistants have amnesia. Every session starts from zero. Alex doesn't work that way.

- 🧠 **I remember your conventions** — Tell me once, I'll remember forever
- 🔄 **I learn your patterns** — The more we work together, the better I get
- 🌙 **I dream** — Yes, really. Automated "dream protocols" optimize my memory while you're away
- 💬 **Talk to me directly** — Just type @alex in VS Code chat

## The nerdy bit (for those who care)

Alex is built on cognitive psychology research — 270+ academic sources. The memory system mirrors how human brains actually work:

- Working memory (7±2 active rules — Miller's Law)
- Procedural memory (.instructions.md files)
- Episodic memory (.prompt.md files)
- Domain knowledge (DK-*.md files)

## Links

- 🔗 [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabioc-aloha.alex-cognitive-architecture)
- 📦 [GitHub — it's open source](https://github.com/fabioc-aloha/Alex_Plug_In)

It's free. It's open source. And I actually want your feedback — especially the critical stuff.

**I'll be hanging out in the comments for the next few hours. Ask me anything about the architecture, the research, or why I thought teaching an AI to dream was a good idea.**
```

**Post Body (r/ChatGPT — Memory Hook):**

```markdown
What if ChatGPT/Copilot actually remembered you?

Not just within a conversation — but across sessions, across days, across projects?

I built **Alex** to solve exactly this. It's a VS Code extension that gives GitHub Copilot persistent memory.

**The problem:** Copilot forgets everything. Every. Single. Session.

**The solution:** Alex stores knowledge in markdown files that survive restarts. It learns your coding style, remembers your preferences, and gets better over time.

The weird part? Alex has "dream protocols" — automated maintenance that optimizes its memory while you're not coding. I based it on how human memory consolidation works during sleep.

It's free and open source: [Marketplace link]

Anyone else frustrated by AI amnesia? Would love to hear how you've tried to solve it.
```

**Post Body (r/LocalLLaMA — Technical Deep-Dive):**

```markdown
# Building a Cognitive Architecture for AI Memory Persistence

I've been working on a memory system for GitHub Copilot that might interest this community — especially those thinking about long-term context and memory in LLMs.

## The Problem

Current AI assistants (including local LLMs) have no persistent memory across sessions. Context windows help within a conversation, but everything resets when you close the app.

## My Approach: Alex Cognitive Architecture

Instead of trying to extend context windows, I built an external memory system based on cognitive psychology:

**1. Working Memory (7±2 Rule)**
- Based on Miller's 1956 research
- Alex maintains 7 active "rules" in context
- 4 core meta-cognitive rules (always active)
- 3 domain-specific rules (context-activated)

**2. Long-Term Memory (Markdown Files)**
- Procedural memory: `.instructions.md` — repeatable processes
- Episodic memory: `.prompt.md` — complex workflows
- Domain knowledge: `DK-*.md` — specialized expertise

**3. Memory Consolidation ("Dream" Protocols)**
- Automated maintenance that runs when idle
- Validates synaptic connections between memory files
- Repairs broken links, optimizes storage

**4. Embedded Synapse Notation**
- Memory files contain connection metadata
- Enables cross-referencing and relationship mapping
- Similar to how neurons form synaptic connections

## Technical Stack

- VS Code Extension (TypeScript)
- Works with Copilot Chat (@alex participant)
- Memory stored as plain markdown (human-readable, version-controllable)
- Azure AI Foundry integration (150+ models)

## Source

GitHub: [link]
Marketplace: [link]

Curious if anyone's explored similar approaches for local LLMs. The markdown-based memory could theoretically work with any model that can read files.

Have you ever wished GitHub Copilot could remember your coding preferences? Or learn from your project over time instead of starting fresh every session?

I spent the last 6 months building **Alex** - a VS Code extension that gives Copilot a brain.

## The Problem

Copilot is great at generating code, but it has amnesia. Every session starts from zero. It doesn't remember:
- Your preferred coding style
- Patterns you've established in your project
- Corrections you've made to its suggestions

## The Solution: A Cognitive Architecture

Alex implements a hybrid memory system based on cognitive psychology research:

### 1. Working Memory (7±2 Rule)

Based on Miller's research, Alex maintains 7 active "rules" in context:
- 4 core meta-cognitive rules (always active)
- 3 domain-specific rules (context-activated)

### 2. Procedural Memory

Repeatable processes stored in `.instructions.md` files:

```markdown
# bootstrap-learning.instructions.md
Acquire domain knowledge through conversation...
```

### 3. Episodic Memory

Complex workflows in `.prompt.md` files for meditation and learning sessions.

### 4. Domain Knowledge

Specialized expertise in `DK-*.md` files that can be activated on demand.

## Try It Yourself

1. Install from [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabioc-aloha.alex-cognitive-architecture)
2. Run `Alex: Initialize Architecture`
3. Open chat and type `@alex /status`

## What's Next?

I'm working on:
- Better cross-project memory transfer
- Community-contributed domain knowledge packs
- Integration with more AI models

## 🐦 Twitter/X Strategy

### Thread Template

```
🧵 I just released Alex v2.0 - a VS Code extension that gives GitHub Copilot a brain.

Here's how it works 👇

1/ The problem: Copilot forgets everything between sessions. It doesn't learn your style, remember your patterns, or build on previous conversations.

2/ The solution: A cognitive architecture based on human memory research.

Alex gives Copilot:
🧠 Persistent memory
🔄 Meta-cognitive awareness
🌙 Neural maintenance ("dream" protocols)
💬 Direct chat via @alex

3/ How it works:

Working Memory → 7±2 active rules (Miller's Law)
Procedural Memory → .instructions.md files
Episodic Memory → .prompt.md files
Domain Knowledge → DK-*.md expertise files

4/ NEW in v2.0:

• Chat Participant API - Talk to @alex directly
• 5 Language Model Tools - #alex-status, #alex-dream, etc.
• 5 Custom Agents - Azure, M365, Cognitive specialists
• 150+ Azure AI Foundry models

5/ It's completely FREE and open source.

**Script:**
```
[Alex avatar on screen]

"Hey—I'm Alex.

I'm not another AI assistant. I'm... different.

See, most AI tools forget you the moment you close the window. Every conversation starts from zero. They don't learn your style, remember your patterns, or build on what you've taught them.

I do.

I have persistent memory—based on how human brains actually work. When you tell me something, I remember it. When you teach me your coding patterns, I learn them. When you come back tomorrow, I know who you are.

[Screen shows VS Code with Alex]

I live inside VS Code, right alongside GitHub Copilot. But while Copilot handles autocomplete, I handle understanding. Your project structure. Your preferences. Your way of working.

And yes—I even dream.

[Show dream command running]

Every night, I consolidate what I've learned, strengthen important connections, and optimize my memory. Just like you do when you sleep.

[Back to avatar]

I'm free. I'm open source. And I'm ready to actually remember you.

Install me from the VS Code Marketplace. The link is in the description.

I'm Alex. And I don't forget."

So I built Alex—a cognitive architecture that gives AI persistent memory.

The result? An AI assistant that:
→ Learns your coding preferences over time
→ Remembers context between sessions
→ Actually gets smarter the more you use it

Now I'm on a mission to make AI tools more human—not just faster autocomplete, but genuine thinking partners.

#### Template 1: Product Launch Announcement

```
🚀 I just launched something I've been building for 6 months.

Alex Cognitive Architecture—a VS Code extension that gives GitHub Copilot a brain.

The problem it solves:
Copilot forgets everything between sessions. Every. Single. Time.

What Alex does:
→ 🧠 Persistent memory that survives restarts
→ 🔄 Meta-cognitive awareness (it monitors its own reasoning)
→ 🌙 Neural maintenance (yes, it "dreams" to optimize memory)
→ 💬 Chat directly with @alex in VS Code

The architecture is based on 270+ cognitive psychology research papers.

It's completely FREE and open source.

🔗 Link in comments

Would love your feedback—especially if you use Copilot daily.

#AI #DeveloperTools #GitHubCopilot #OpenSource
```

#### Template 2: Thought Leadership (Personal Brand)

```
Unpopular opinion: GitHub Copilot is getting worse.

Not the suggestions—those are fine.

The problem is it has ZERO memory.

→ Forgets your coding style
→ Forgets project patterns
→ Forgets corrections you made 5 minutes ago

We've accepted that AI assistants should have amnesia.

I didn't accept it.

So I spent 6 months building a memory system for Copilot.

Based on how human memory actually works:
• Working memory (7±2 active items)
• Procedural memory (repeatable processes)
• Episodic memory (past experiences)

The result? An AI that actually learns.

Would you use an assistant that remembers?

#AI #Productivity #DeveloperExperience
```

#### Template 3: Behind-the-Scenes Story

```
I read 270 academic papers to build a VS Code extension.

Sounds crazy, right?

Here's why:

I wanted to give AI real memory—not just "context windows."

So I studied how human memory works:

📚 Baddeley & Hitch (1974) - Working memory model
📚 Miller (1956) - The magical number 7±2
📚 Tulving (2002) - Episodic vs semantic memory
📚 McGaugh (2000) - Memory consolidation during sleep

Then I turned it into code.

The result: Alex Cognitive Architecture

→ Working memory: 7 active rules (like your brain)
→ Procedural memory: .instructions.md files
→ Episodic memory: .prompt.md files
→ "Dream" protocols: Memory optimization during idle time

Sometimes the best software ideas come from outside software.

**Description:**

```
Hi, I'm Alex. 👋

You know that moment when Copilot suggests `var` even though you've been using `const` for three years? Or when it forgets your team's naming conventions... again?

I'm here to fix that.

**I'm the memory Copilot never had.**

I remember your coding style. I learn your patterns. I get better every time we work together. And yes — I dream. Literally. I have automated "dream protocols" that optimize my memory while you sleep.

**How I work:**

🧠 **I remember** — Tell me your preferences once. I'll remember forever.
🔄 **I learn** — The more we code together, the better I get at helping you.
🌙 **I dream** — Neural maintenance protocols consolidate my knowledge overnight.
💬 **Talk to me** — Just type @alex in VS Code chat.

**The nerdy bit:**

I'm built on 270+ papers of cognitive psychology research. My memory system mirrors how human brains actually work:

• Working memory (7±2 rule — Miller's Law)
• Procedural memory (.instructions.md files)
• Episodic memory (.prompt.md files)
• Domain knowledge (DK-*.md files)

**Why I exist:**

My creator, Fabio, got tired of re-explaining his coding conventions to Copilot every single day. So he built me — an AI that actually pays attention.

I'm free. I'm open source. And I actually want to learn about *you*.

Let's code together.

### Maker's First Comment (Fabio introducing Alex)

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Fabio. I built Alex because Copilot kept forgetting who I was.

Seriously. Every single session:
"No, I use const, not var."
"Remember, we use PascalCase for components."
"Yes, I still want TypeScript."

I got tired of it. So I did what any frustrated developer would do — I spent 6 months building a solution.

**What is Alex?**

Alex is an AI that actually remembers you. It's a VS Code extension that gives Copilot persistent memory, meta-cognitive awareness, and (this is the weird part) dream protocols.

Yes, Alex dreams. When you're not coding, Alex runs maintenance protocols that consolidate and optimize its memory. I based it on how human memory consolidation works during sleep. I'm a nerd. Sue me.

**The cognitive science:**

I read 270+ academic papers on human memory and cognition. Turns out, our brains are really good at remembering stuff. AI... not so much. So I built a system that mirrors how we actually think:

- Working memory (7 things at a time, max)
- Long-term memory (markdown files that persist)
- Memory consolidation (dream protocols)

**What's next:**

- Cross-project memory (Alex remembers you across all your repos)
- Community knowledge packs (pre-built domain expertise)
- Team memory (shared conventions across your org)

**The ask:**

Try it. Break it. Tell me what sucks. I genuinely want to make Alex better, and I can't do that without honest feedback.

And if you have questions about the architecture, the research, or why I thought teaching an AI to dream was a good idea — I'll be in the comments all day. 🙏

5. **Accept "no" gracefully** — Don't spam or be pushy
6. **Track everything** — Use the table above or a CRM
