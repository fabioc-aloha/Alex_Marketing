---

## 🎭 Indirect Competition

### "Good Enough" Syndrome
**The biggest competitor is doing nothing.**

Many developers have normalized:
- Re-explaining context every session
- Inconsistent code suggestions
- Starting fresh each conversation

**Strategy:**
- Education about what's possible
- Show the pain they've accepted
- "You don't have to live like this"

### Inertia
**Switching costs are real.**

Even if Alex is better, people need a reason to:
- Install another extension
- Learn another tool
- Change their workflow

**Strategy:**
- Emphasize minimal setup (one command)
- Works with existing Copilot (not replacement)
- Quick wins in first session
- Low commitment to try

## 📣 Competitive Messaging by Scenario

### When someone mentions Cursor
> "Cursor's great if you want to switch IDEs. Alex works with your existing VS Code + Copilot setup—no migration needed. Plus, you can actually see and edit what Alex remembers."

### When someone mentions ChatGPT memory
> "ChatGPT's memory is general-purpose and lives in OpenAI's cloud. Alex is built specifically for coding, and the memory lives in your repo where you can see, edit, and version-control it."

### When someone mentions Copilot memory
> "Copilot's memory is a start, but can you see what it remembers? Edit it? Take it with you? Alex gives you transparent, portable memory you actually own."

### When someone mentions Cline/Aider
> "Cline and Aider are autonomous agents—they code FOR you. Alex codes WITH you. If you're worried about losing your skills to AI, Alex is the partnership model."

### When someone says "I just use custom prompts"
> "That's exactly what Alex does—but with active learning. Instead of manually updating your prompts, Alex learns and consolidates automatically. Same transparency, less maintenance."
