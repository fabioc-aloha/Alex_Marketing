## Brand Design System

### Color Palette Rationale

| Color | Hex | Psychology | Application |
|-------|-----|------------|-------------|
| **VS Code Blue** | `#007ACC` | Trust, technology, familiarity | Primary CTA, links, brand recognition |
| **Growth Green** | `#4CAF50` | Progress, success, life | Accents, success states, memory nodes |
| **Deep Navy** | `#1a1a2e` | Depth, sophistication, focus | Dark backgrounds, headers |
| **Ocean Blue** | `#0f3460` | Depth, calm, professionalism | Gradients, secondary backgrounds |

### Neural Network Visual Language

The brand's visual identity uses neural network imagery to communicate:
1. **Interconnected nodes** = Transparent memory points
2. **Synaptic connections** = Knowledge relationships
3. **Brain-like shapes** = Cognitive architecture
4. **Layered networks** = Working memory + long-term storage

### Asset Specifications

| Asset Type | Dimensions | Primary Use |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| Banner | 1280×640 | README, social headers, Marketplace |
| Badge | 200×40 | Inline references, shields |
| Icon | 128×128 | Favicons, profile pictures |
| Thumbnail | 1280×720 | YouTube, video content |
| Social Preview | 1200×630 | Open Graph, link previews |

## Multi-Document Consistency Framework

### Cross-Reference Validation Protocol

When maintaining multiple marketing documents:

1. **Feature Claims** - Same features listed identically across all docs
2. **Pricing** - Consistent tier names and prices (Free/$9 Pro/$29 Team/Custom Enterprise)
3. **Statistics** - Same numbers cited everywhere (update all or none)
4. **Voice** - Alex speaks in first person consistently
5. **Visual Style** - Same colors, fonts, diagram styles

### Consistency Checklist

```markdown
Before publishing any marketing content:
- [ ] Feature list matches across all channels
- [ ] Pricing unchanged or updated everywhere
- [ ] Screenshots current with actual UI
- [ ] Links tested and working
- [ ] Alex voice maintained (first person, confident, transparent)
- [ ] Brand colors correct (#007ACC, #4CAF50)
```
